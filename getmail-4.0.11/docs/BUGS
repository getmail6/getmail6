Reporting bugs
==============

Regarding packages/ports/emerges/etc
------------------------------------

CRITICAL:  if you are using a "package"/"emerge"/"port" of getmail, DO NOT
REPORT PROBLEMS TO ME.  Report them to your OS vendor or packager -- only
they can help you with problems introduced by their packaging of getmail,
and only they (and I) can reliably determine whether a problem is in
getmail, or in their packaging (it's usually the latter).  So report problems
to whoever created the package/port you're using, and if the packager is sure
it's a problem in getmail, they can report it to me.

If you want to report a getmail problem to me, please ensure that you have
installed from the tarball or noarch RPM file which I provide.  Then follow
the rest of the instructions below.

How to report a problem with getmail
------------------------------------

IMPORTANT:  Please include the output of 

  getmail [your usual options] --dump

and a copy of your getmail rc file(s) (with password masked) with any bug 
report.

IMPORTANT:  Ensure you have upgraded to the latest version of getmail (from the 
website at http://www.qcc.ca/~charlesc/software/getmail-4/) before reporting a 
bug.  Most bugs are fixed after the first report.

If you find a bug in getmail, please either join the getmail users' mailing
list and report it there (preferred), or send it to me at 
<getmail-bugs @ discworld.dyndns.org>.

You can join the getmail users' mailing list by sending a (blank) message
to <getmail-subscribe @ discworld.dnsalias.org>.
