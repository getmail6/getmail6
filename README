getmail6
========

getmail6 is a flexible, extensible mail retrieval system with
support for POP3, IMAP4, SSL variants of both, maildirs, mboxrd files,
external MDAs, arbitrary message filtering, single-user and domain-mailboxes,
and many other useful features.

getmail is Copyright (C) 1998-2020 Charles Cazabon and others.
getmail is licensed for use under the GNU General Public License version 2 (only).
See ``docs/COPYING`` for specific terms and distribution information.

getmail6 has adaptations to work with Python 3.
These changes might still contain some bugs.
Please report them at https://github.com/getmail6/getmail6.
See ``docs/BUGS`` for instructions on reporting bugs.

getmail6 will probably not work with Python versions older than 2.7.
Use getmail 5.14 with them.

Installation
------------

To install::

  pip install getmail6

To uninstall::

  pip uninstall getmail6

You can install getmail6 in your home directory if you add ``--user``.

If getmail6 is available via your Linux distribution, you better use that.

Before using ``getmail`` you must configure it.

  type = SimpleIMAPSSLRetriever

  port = 993
  username = <your_email_here>
  #password = ... or
  password_command = ("pass", "<your_email_here>")

  [destination]
  type = Maildir
  path = ~/Mail/<your_email_here>/INBOX/

  [options]
  read_all = true
  delete = true
