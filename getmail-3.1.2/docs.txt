Installing getmail

   Follow these steps to install getmail:
    1. Download getmail.
    2. Unpack the tarball.
tar xzf getmail-version.tar.gz
    3. Copy the contents to a suitable location:
mkdir /usr/lib/getmail
cp -a getmail-version/* /usr/lib/getmail/
                               You can install getmail in your home
       directory or elsewhere if you prefer. If you use a directory other
       than /usr/lib/getmail/, change the definition of GETMAILPATH in
       the getmail wrapper script or ensure the directory you choose is
       in your PYTHONPATH environment variable.
    4. Copy the getmail helper script to a location in your PATH, and
       ensure it is executable:
cp -a getmail-version/getmail /usr/bin/
chmod 755 /usr/bin/getmail
       
Configuring getmail

    1. Create a getmail configuration/data directory in your home
       directory:
mkdir ~/.getmail
       You can use another path or directory name, but getmail assumes
       this name by default. If you choose something different, you will
       need to specify its name on the getmail command line with the
       --getmaildir option.
    2. Create a configuration file named getmailrc in the directory you
       created in step 1 above (see the section Configuration file below
       for details). You can use another file name or path, but getmail
       assumes this name by default. If you choose something different,
       you will need to specify its name on the getmail command line with
       the --rcfile option.
       
Configuration file

   A getmail configuration file (typically named getmailrc, and located
   in $HOME/.getmail/) looks similar to an MS-Windows .INI file. For
   security reasons, your getmailrc file must not be group- or
   world-writable. getmail will refuse to run if it finds your getmailrc
   file is writable by others.
   
   The file is broken into sections. Each section starts with an
   arbitrary label surrounded by square brackets:
[section name]

   A section then contains one or more lines in name = value format.
   Values containing whitespace must be surrounded with single- or
   double-quotes. The pound sign (#) introduces a comment, which
   continues until the end of the line.
foo = 42
bar = "string value containing spaces"
baz = ""           # This is a comment; baz is an empty value

   To include a pound sign in an option value, quote it. Percent signs
   (%) must be doubled; for example, if you want to specify a password of
   foo%bar, use the following:
password = foo%%bar

   The special section [default] must be the first section in the file;
   it supplies default values for options in other sections. For example,
   to set the option verbose to 1 for all following sections, you could
   put it in the [default] section:
[default]
verbose = 1

[my home account]
username = foobar
password = "my password"
...

[my work account]
username = foobar
password = "my password"
...

   getmail ignores whitespace surrounding the = sign. The following lines
   are equivalent:
account = joe.bloggs
account=joe.bloggs
account=   joe.bloggs

   Option values containing single or double quote characters can be
   quoted with the other character:
password = "this is a more 'secure' password"

   To un-set an option taking a string value, set it to the empty string:
message_log = ""         # Previously set to /var/log/getmail; turn it off for
this account

   Other sections in a getmail configuration file represent POP3 accounts
   to retrieve mail from, one per account. The section name is
   unimportant, but must be unique. An example account section might look
   like this:
[Home ISP account]
server = mailhost.isp.tld
username = brenda.bjorn
password = "my mail password"
postmaster = ~brendab/Maildir/  # Deliver all mail to the Maildir in my home di
rectory

   When getmail tries to determine the value of an option, it looks at
   the following, in order, until it finds a match:
    1. Options specified on the command line
    2. Options specified in an account section of the getmail
       configuration file
    3. Options specified in the [default] section of the getmail
       configuration file
    4. getmail's built-in default value
       
POP3 Account types

   There are two different types of POP3 email accounts:
     * regular mailboxes
     * domain mailboxes
       
Regular mailbox

   This is a typical POP3 mailbox provided by an ISP for a single user.
   It receives mail addressed to a single user (say,
   shannon.fotheringham@aqua.myisp.tld). For this type of account, the
   minimum configuration would be something like this:
[My Aqua Account]
server = mailhost.aqua.myisp.tld
username = shannon.fotheringham
postmaster = ~shannonf/Maildir/

   This postmaster directive tells getmail to deliver all mail to
   Shannon's Maildir. Since a password was not configured, getmail will
   prompt the user for it when run.
   
Domain mailbox

   This type of POP3 account is typically provided by an ISP to a small
   company or organization. It receives mail addressed to any user in a
   given domain. For example, mail to info@smallcompany.tld,
   tgrieg@smallcompany.tld, and sales@smallcompany.tld all ends up in the
   same POP3 domain mailbox.
   
   getmail includes features to enable retrieval of mail from this type
   of account, filter it according to who the mail was addressed to, and
   deliver it to different destinations. A minimal configuration with
   this type of setup would be something like this:
[Company domain mailbox]
server = mailhost.largeisp.tld
username = small.company
password = RRt49slP32m
envelope_recipient = delivered-to:1
postmaster = ~tgrieg/Mail/postmaster-maildir/
local = tgrieg@smallcompany.tld,~tgrieg/Mail/personal-maildir/
local = info@smallcompany.tld,~bobf/Maildir/
local = sales@smallcompany.tld,~darlab/Maildir/

   The local directives tell getmail to deliver mail for those users to
   their various mail spools on the system, and the postmaster directive
   tells getmail to deliver any mail which doesn't match any of the local
   directives somewhere else.
   
   To make getmail sort mail (with local directives like the above) based
   on the envelope recipient address, you must either enable the use_*env
   option (if your mailhost supports it) or use the envelope_recipient
   directive.
   
Message Delivery Targets

   In a getmailrc file, postmaster and local directives contain message
   delivery targets, which instruct getmail to delivery messages in a
   particular manner. A message delivery target may be a qmail-style
   Maildir or an arbitrary command (such as an external Message Delivery
   Agent or MDA).
   Target Type Syntax Notes
   Maildir /path/to/Maildir/ Maildir targets must have a trailing slash
   Command |/path/to/command [arguments] Command deliveries must start
   with a pipe (|). Remember to quote values containing whitespace.
   
   For command deliveries, getmail provides the following environment
   variables.
     * SENDER contains the envelope sender address as extracted from the
       Return-Path: header field or *ENV results.
     * RECIPIENT contains the envelope recipient address as extracted
       from the user-configured envelope_recipient header field or *ENV
       results.
     * EXT contains the extension portion of RECIPIENT calculated with
       the user-supplied values of extension_sep and extension_depth
       directives. This is primarily useful for external MDAs such as
       TMDA.
       
   Note the following restrictions:
     * getmail refuses to run external commands when running as root.
     * If an external command writes to stderr, getmail will consider the
       delivery a failure. If you know your MDA can write to stderr on a
       successful delivery, either supply a --quiet option to the MDA (if
       it supports such), or throw away or redirect stderr in one of the
       following manners:
postmaster = "|/path/to/mda [options] 2>/dev/null"
postmaster = "|/path/to/mda [options] 2>&1"
       This will, of course, also work with delivery targets in local
       directives.
     * getmail will not create Maildirs if they do not exist. You must
       create them prior to having getmail deliver mail to them. Use
       maildirmake to create empty Maildirs.
     * getmail requires write access to any Maildir you wish to deliver
       mail to. This can be done my making the Maildirs group-writable by
       the group you run getmail under, for example. There are other ways
       as well.
       
   Leading tilde characters (~) on paths will be expanded -- i.e.
   ~jason/Maildir/ likely becomes /home/jason/Maildir/ on most systems.

POP3 Server Configuration

   The following directives are used to configure which POP3 servers
   getmail will retrieve mail from.
   
POP3 Server Hostname

   Function               Specify POP3 server to connect to.
   Syntax                 server = hostname.domain.tld
   Optional               No
   Default                None
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples               server = pop3.isp.com
   
POP3 TCP Port

   Function               Specify TCP port on POP3 server to connect to.
   Syntax                 port = portnumber
   Optional               Yes
   Default                110 (Default POP3 port)
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples               port = 8110
   
POP3 TCP timeout

   Function Specify the TCP timeout to use with an account.
   Syntax timeout = value (seconds)
   Optional Yes
   Default 180
   Commandline equivalent --timeout = value (seconds)
   Examples timeout = 360
   Note The TCP timeout capabilities are enabled by the timeoutsocket.py
   module by Timothy O'Malley. A copy of timeoutsocket.py is included
   with getmail; however, getmail will continue to function (without this
   capability) if the timeoutsocket module is not present.

POP3 Account Configuration

   The following directives are used to configure which POP3 accounts
   getmail will retrieve mail from.
   
POP3 account username

   Function Specify the account name for the POP3 server.
   Syntax username = user
   Optional No
   Default None
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples username = joe.bloggs
   username = joe.bloggs:vhost.example.net
   
POP3 account password

   Function Specify password to use with POP3 account
   Syntax password = password
   Optional Yes
   Default Prompt for password
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples password = "long password containing whitespace"
   password = foo_bar
   
POP3 APOP authentication

   Function Use POP3 APOP authentication if available. Falls back to
   USER/PASS authentication if not supported.
   Syntax use_apop = bool
   Optional Yes
   Default 0 (USER/PASS authentication)
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples use_apop = 1
   use_apop = 0
   
Message Formatting

   The following directives are specified in any getmailrc section, and
   are used to configure how getmail will format messages that it
   retrieves.
   
Delivered-To: header field suppression

   Function Suppress the addition of a Delivered-To: header field to
   messages that getmail retrieves.
   Syntax no_delivered_to = bool
   Optional Yes
   Default 0 (No)
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples no_delivered_to = 1
   no_delivered_to = 0
   
Received: header field suppression

   Function Suppress the addition of a Received: header field to messages
   that getmail retrieves.
   Syntax no_received = bool
   Optional Yes
   Default 0 (No)
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples no_received = 1
   no_received = 0
   
Message Delivery Targets

   The following directives are specified in any getmailrc section, and
   are used to configure where getmail will deliver retrieved messages.
   Also see the section on message delivery targets.
   
Default delivery target

   Function In non-domain mailbox operation, specifies the delivery
   target for all retrieved mail.
   In domain mailbox operation, this specifies the default delivery
   target for all retrieved messages which are not handled by a matching
   local directive.
   Syntax postmaster = target
   Optional No
   Default None
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples postmaster = /home/joe/Maildir/
   postmaster = "|/usr/local/bin/my_mda -f foo -a all -b gone
   /home/postmaster/.mdarc"
   
Header field pattern matching delivery target

   Function Specify the destination for retrieved messages which have an
   envelope recipient address which matches a given pattern. getmail will
   match the specified Perl- compatible extended regular expression
   against the envelope recipient address (retrieved using *ENV support
   or found in the header field specified with the envelope_recipient
   directive). If a match is found, the message will be delivered to the
   specified target. If multiple local directives contain matching
   patterns, each matching target will receive a copy of the message. If
   there are no local directives, or no match is found, the message will
   be delivered according to the default delivery target.
   If you do not understand Perl-compatible regular expressions, just use
   email addresses here. They will work in virtually all cases.
   Use multiple local directives to filter mail retrieved from a domain
   mailbox to multiple local user accounts.
   Note that local directives can only be used in multidrop mode.
   Syntax local = pattern,target
   Optional Yes
   Default None
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples local = joe@isp.tld,~joe/Maildir/
   local = brenda@homeisp.tld,/home/brenda/Mail/personal/
   local = brenda@workisp.tld,/home/brenda/Mail/work/
   local = "^(joe|fred)@company\.(tld|dom.tld)$,|/path/to/mda -opts"
   
Recipient header field specification

   Function Extract envelope recipient address from listed header field.
   This directive enables domain mailbox operation and is useful only if
   the POP3 server records envelope recipient addresses in a specific
   header field (i.e. Delivered-To: or X-Envelope-To:).
   Use it if wish to process mail from a domain mailbox, sorting and
   delivering it to multiple local user accounts using local directives.
   Syntax envelope_recipient = fieldname:fieldnum
   fieldnum refers to the occurrence of that header field; the value 2 is
   the second occurrence of fieldname.
   Optional Yes
   Default None
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples envelope_recipient = Delivered-To:2
   envelope_recipient = X-Envelope-To:1
   
SPDS *ENV POP3 Extension

   Function Retrieve envelope sender and recipient addresses from the
   server using Demon's SPDS *ENV POP3 extension (described at
   http://www.demon.net/helpdesk/products/mail/sdps-tech.shtml).
   This directive enables domain mailbox operation and overrides the
   envelope_recipient directive.
   Syntax use_*env = bool
   Optional Yes
   Default 0 (No)
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples use_*env = 1
   use_*env = 0
   
User address extension separator character

   Function Determine which part of a recipient address is the extension
   to the base address.
   This directive is mostly useful if the POP3 server records envelope
   recipient addresses in a specific header field (i.e. Delivered-To: or
   X-Envelope-To:), and you wish to deliver mail using TMDA or another
   filtering MDA.
   getmail will export the detected envelope recipient address in the
   environment variable RECIPIENT. It will then split the local-part of
   the address at the first occurrence of this character (default: -),
   and export anything after it as the environment variable EXT.
   Note that you will still need a wrapper script around your filtering
   MDA; getmail will consider a delivery failed if the MDA returns
   non-zero. This is left as an excercise for the reader/user of TMDA.
   Syntax extension_sep = character
   Optional Yes
   Default -
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples extension_sep = +
   extension_sep = -
   
User address extension base length/depth

   Function Determine which part of a recipient address is the extension
   to the base address.
   This directive is mostly useful if the POP3 server records envelope
   recipient addresses in a specific header field (i.e. Delivered-To: or
   X-Envelope-To:), and you wish to deliver mail using TMDA or another
   filtering MDA.
   If you are using a local directive to configure delivery of mail
   per-recipient, getmail will export the detected envelope recipient
   address in the environment variable RECIPIENT. It will then remove the
   base part of the address at the extension_depth occurrence of the
   extension separator character.
   Syntax extension_depth = count
   Optional Yes
   Default 1
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples extension_depth = 2
   
Message Retrieval

   The following directives are specified in any getmailrc section, and
   are used to configure how getmail will retrieve messages.
   
Retrieve new messages / retrieve all messages

   Function Select whether to retrieve all messages, or only messages
   which have previously not been seen by getmail.
   Syntax readall = bool
   Optional Yes
   Default 1 (Retrieve all messages)
   Commandline equivalent --all (readall = 1)
   --new (readall = 0)
   Examples readall = 1
   readall = 0
   
Maximum message size to retrieve

   Function Specify a maximum message size to retrieve. Messages larger
   than this will be left on the server and not retrieved.
   Syntax max_message_size = value (bytes)
   Optional Yes
   Default 0 (No limit)
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples max_message_size = 2000000
   max_message_size = 150000
   
Maximum message size to retrieve

   Function Specify a maximum message size to retrieve. Messages larger
   than this will be left on the server and not retrieved.
   Syntax max_message_size = value (bytes)
   Optional Yes
   Default 0 (No limit)
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples max_message_size = 2000000
   max_message_size = 150000
   
Delete messages from server after retrieval

   Function Delete messages from the POP3 server after retrieval.
   Syntax delete = bool
   Optional Yes
   Default 0 (Do not delete)
   Commandline equivalent --dont-delete (delete = 0)
   --delete (delete = 1)
   Examples delete = 1
   delete = 0
   
Delete messages X days after retrieval

   Function Delete messages a specified number of days after they are
   first retrieved.
   Note: delete overrides delete_after.
   Syntax delete_after = value (days)
   Optional Yes
   Default 0 (Do not use delete_after)
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples delete_after = 3
   delete_after = 180
   
getmail Behaviour

   The following directives are specified in any getmailrc section, and
   are used to control other aspects of getmail's behaviour.
   
Verbosity

   Function Specify whether getmail writes status and informational
   messages to stdout while running.
   Syntax verbose = bool
   Optional Yes
   Default 1 (Verbose)
   Commandline equivalent --verbose (verbose = 1)
   --quiet (verbose = 0)
   Examples verbose = 1
   verbose = 0
   
Message Logging

   Function Specify whether getmail writes message retrieval and delivery
   information to a log file. Set to the empty string to disable logging.
   This value is expanded for leading "~" or "~user".
   Syntax message_log = file
   Optional Yes
   Default None
   Commandline equivalent None
   Examples message_log = /var/log/getmail
   message_log = ""
   
Running getmail

   Run the getmail helper script you installed earlier:
getmail

   By default, getmail will read in the default getmailrc file
   ($HOME/.getmail/getmailrc) and begin retrieving mail.
   
   You can also supply commandline options. For a brief summary of usage
   and commandline options, run:
getmail --help
