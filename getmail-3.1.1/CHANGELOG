getmail changes since version 2.x:
----------------------------------

Version 3.1.1
14 March 2003

  -Add additional info to message log (msg #, msg count, size) "new msg"
  status line.  Thanks to Payal Rathod for the feature request.

Version 3.1.0
21 February 2003

  -Rename the recipient_header directive to "envelope_recipient".  There was
  simply too much confusion about it.  Sorry, but you'll have to update
  your getmailrc file and rename this directive if you're using it.  This
  version was going to be 3.0.5, but this change necessitates bumping the
  version up to 3.1.0.
  -Include separate callable program for mbox delivery.  The program,
  getmail_mbox, is based on the mbox delivery code in getmail version
  2.3.  It assumes mboxrd format and flock locking; if other programs
  on your system expect a different subtype of mbox format or use a different
  locking method, you can corrupt your mbox file.  Use at your own risk.
  You can use this in a command delivery target from getmail
  as "|/path/to/getmail_mbox /path/to/mboxfile" .
  -In a similar vein, include separate callable program for maildir delivery.
  The program, getmail_maildir, uses the same maildir delivery code as
  getmail.  You can use this in a command delivery target from getmail
  as "|/path/to/getmail_maildir /path/to/maildir/" .  This is mostly useful
  if you want to deliver to a maildir after doing something else to the message,
  and can be used in place of safecat.
  -Add message filtering.  You can now pass messages through arbitrary
  filters before delivery; specify one or more message_filter directives,
  each of which is a command and arguments.  The filter(s) should read the
  message from stdin, write to stdout, and exit 0 for success, 99 to drop
  the message in the bitbucket, and anything else to indicate an error.
  No docs for this yet.
  -getmail could drop the final newline when delivering to Maildirs in
  some circumstances.  Thanks to Jason Mastaler for the report and testing.

Version 3.0.4
20 February 2003

  -Catch a user incorrectly specifying two values for recipient_header.
  Thanks to Francisco Stefano Wechsler for the report.
  -Update ConfParser to version 3.3, designed to make it easier to catch
  user configuration errors.
  -Update configuration-handling code to use new features of ConfParser 3.3
  above, report configuration errors more clearly.  Thanks to Francisco
  Stefano Wechsler for the report which got me looking at this.
  -Add explicit check for recipient_header specifying a known-incorrect
  value.  Thanks to Edward Davis for the report that got me looking at this.
  -Move some sanity checks around to report errors earlier.

Version 3.0.3
14 February 2003

  -Missing import in getmail_utilities.py affected those who let getmail
  prompt them for a password.  Thanks to Francisco Stefano Wechsler for the
  report.

Version 3.0.2
14 February 2003

  -My editor let CR LF line endings into getmail_utilities.py ; this caused
  problems for at least one person.  Thanks to Francisco Stefano Wechsler
  for the report.  Now fixed.

Version 3.0.1
13 February 2003

  -Have getmail report an error if local directives are specified but getmail
  is not operating in multidrop mode (through either of the "use_*env" or 
  "recipient_header" directives).  Thanks to Gerwin Krist for reporting that 
  this was not obvious.

Version 3.0.0
10 February 2003

  -Updated to version 1.23 of Timothy O'Malley's timeoutsocket.py
  from http://www.timo-tasi.org/python/timeoutsocket.py
  -not all configuration errors were being caught in ConfParser.  Updated
  ConfParser as a result; thanks to Christian Pelster for reporting and testing
  this.
  -Move lots of code around.  Much has been moved into separate files.
  Much other code has been cleaned up.
  -Add support for Demon's SPDS "*ENV" command for domain mailboxes.
  Thanks to Paul Clifford for the request and the pointer to Demon's 
  explanation of this protocol extension, submission of a patch to
  getmail 2.3.x for this feature, and for a testing 3.0 in its pre-release
  state.  Paul also submitted several patches during pre-release testing
  which I accepted.
  -Change main delivery loop; individual message delivery failures are
  not considered fatal errors any more.  The messages will be left on the
  server and retried.
  -Remove mbox delivery code.  Use an external MDA for this; for safety
  and reliability, all mbox-delivery programs on a system have to be compiled
  to use the same method of mbox locking in any case.  I don't use mbox
  files at all.
  -Simplify handling of oldmail data files.
  -Domain mailboxes are now only supported with explicit configuration of
  a header field which records the envelope recipient address or with *ENV.
  This removes a lot of code and makes the logic simpler.
  -Remove duplicate filtering option.  Use an external MDA for this.
  -Change maildir delivery algorithm; getmail will now try up to three times
  to generate a valid, unique name in maildir/tmp/, sleeping two seconds
  between tries as recommended by djb.  This code is also now moved into
  an independant function in getmail_utilities.py for easier use by others.
  The file naming convention has changed to djb's "modern delivery
  identifiers".
