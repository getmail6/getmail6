#
# This file contains various examples of configuration sections to use
# in your getmail rc file.  You need one file for each mail account you
# want to retrieve mail from.  These files should be placed in your
# getmail configuration/data directory 
# (default: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/getmail/ or $HOME/.getmail/).
# If you only need one rc file, name it getmailrc in that directory,
# and you won't need to supply any commandline options to run getmail.
#

# Example 12:  xoauth2 example
# To initialize do:
#
# Step1: Create a new OAuth 2.0 Client-ID 
# 
# Go to the google page for „OAuth 2.0 for Mobile & Desktop Apps“
# https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app
# 
# Follow the link to the Credentials page: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials
# 
# Create a new client id + secret for your getmail
# 
# Step 2: Add the new credentials to the gmail.json template
# 
# {"scope": "https://mail.google.com/",
#  "user": "your-gmail-user@gmail.com",
#  "client_id": "the new client id",
#  "client_secret": "the new secret",
#  "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",

#  "redirect_uri": "urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob",
#  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"}
#
# Step 3: excecute:  
#
#    getmail-gmail-xoauth-tokens --init /path-to-your-users-getmail-directory/gmail.json
# 
# This will give you a URL you need to open in a browser.
# This will show you your verification code.
# 
# getmail-gmail-xoauth-tokens is waiting for you to enter the verification code.
# Once you enter the code 
# 
# getmail-gmail-xoauth-tokens will update the gmail.json file.
# 
# Step 4: Update the `[retriever] `section of the rc file.
