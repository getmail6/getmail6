                              Configuring getmail

   Once getmail is installed, you need to configure it before you can
   retrieve mail with it. Follow these steps:

    1. Create a data/configuration directory. The default is
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/getmail/ or $HOME/.getmail/. If you choose a
       different location, you will need to specify it on the getmail command
       line. In general, other users should not be able to read the contents
       of this directory, so you should set the permissions on it
       appropriately.

 mkdir -m 0700 $HOME/.getmail
        

    2. Create a configuration file in the configuration/data directory. The
       default name is getmailrc. If you choose a different filename, you
       will need to specify it on the getmail command line. If you want to
       retrieve mail from more than one mail account, you will need to create
       a separate rc file for each account getmail should retrieve mail from.

Creating a getmail rc file

   The configuration file format is designed to be easy to understand (both
   for getmail, and for the user). It is broken down into small sections of
   related parameters by section headers which appear on lines by themselves,
   enclosed in square brackets, like this:

 [section name]

   Each section contains a series of parameters, declared as follows:

 parameter_name = parameter_value

   A parameter value, if necessary, can span multiple lines. To indicate that
   the second and subsequent lines form a continuation of the previous line,
   they need to begin with leading whitespace, like this:

 first_parameter = value
     first parameter value continues here
 second_parameter = value

   You can annotate your configuration files with comments by putting them on
   lines which begin with a pound sign, like this:

 first_parameter = value
 # I chose this value because of etc.
 second_parameter = value

   Each rc file requires at least two specific sections. The first is
   retriever, which tells getmail about the mail account to retrieve messages
   from. The second is destination, which tells getmail what to do with the
   retrieved messages. There is also an optional section named options ,
   which gives getmail general configuration information (such as whether to
   log its actions to a file), and other sections can be used to tell getmail
   to filter retrieved messages through other programs, or to deliver
   messages for particular users in a particular way.

  Parameter types and formats

   Several different types of parameters are used in getmail rc files:

     * string
     * integer
     * boolean
     * tuple of quoted strings
     * tuple of integers
     * tuple of 2-tuples

   Each parameter type has a specific format that must be used to represent
   it in the getmail rc file. They are explained below. Each parameter
   documented later specifies its type explicitly.

    string

   Specify a string parameter value with no special syntax:

 parameter = my value

    integer

   Specify an integer parameter value with no special syntax:

 parameter = 4150

    boolean

   A boolean parameter is true or false; you can specify its value with the
   (case-insensitive) words "true" and "false". The values "yes", "on" and 1
   are accepted as equivalent to "true", while values "no", "off" and 0 are
   accepted as equivalent to "false". Some examples:

 parameter = True
 parameter = false
 parameter = NO
 parameter = 1

    tuple of quoted strings

   A tuple of quoted strings is essentially a list of strings, with each
   string surrounded by matching double- or single-quote characters to
   indicate where it begins and ends. The list must be surrounded by open-
   and close-parenthesis characters. A tuple may have to be a specific number
   of strings; for instance, a "2-tuple" must consist of two quoted strings,
   while a "4-tuple" must have exactly four. In most cases, the number of
   strings is not required to be a specific number, and it will not be
   specified in this fashion.

   In general, a tuple of quoted strings parameter values should look like
   this:

 parameter = ('first string', 'second string',
     "third string that contains a ' character")

   However, tuples of 0 or 1 strings require special treatment. The empty
   tuple is specified with just the open- and close-parenthesis characters:

 parameter = ()

   A tuple containing a single quoted string requires a comma to indicate it
   is a tuple:

 parameter = ("single string", )

    tuple of integers

   This is very similar to a tuple of quoted strings, above, minus the
   quotes. Some examples:

 parameter = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
 parameter = (37, )
 parameter = ()

    tuple of 2-tuples

   This is a tuple of items, each of which is a 2-tuple of quoted strings.
   You can think of this as a list of pairs of quoted strings.

 # Three pairs
 parameter = (
     ("first-a", "first-b"),
     ("second-a", "second-b"),
     ("third-a", "third-b"),
     )
 # One pair
 parameter = (
     ("lone-a", "lone-b"),
     )

  Creating the [retriever] section

   The retriever section of the rc file tells getmail what mail account to
   retrieve mail from, and how to access that account. Begin with the section
   header line as follows:

 [retriever]

   Then, include a type string parameter to tell getmail what type of mail
   retriever to use to retrieve mail from this account. The possible values
   are:

     * SimplePOP3Retriever — for single-user POP3 mail accounts.
     * BrokenUIDLPOP3Retriever — for broken POP3 servers that do not support
       the UIDL command, or which do not uniquely identify messages; this
       provides basic support for single-user POP3 mail accounts on such
       servers.
     * SimpleIMAPRetriever — for single-user IMAP mail accounts.
     * SimplePOP3SSLRetriever — same as SimplePOP3Retriever, but uses SSL
       encryption.
     * BrokenUIDLPOP3SSLRetriever — same as BrokenUIDLPOP3Retriever, but uses
       SSL encryption.
     * SimpleIMAPSSLRetriever — same as SimpleIMAPRetriever, but uses SSL
       encryption.
     * MultidropPOP3Retriever — for domain mailbox (multidrop) POP3 mail
       accounts.
     * MultidropPOP3SSLRetriever — same as MultidropPOP3Retriever, but uses
       SSL encryption.
     * MultidropSDPSRetriever — for domain mailbox SDPS mail accounts, as
       provided by the UK ISP Demon.
     * MultidropIMAPRetriever — for domain mailbox (multidrop) IMAP mail
       accounts.
     * MultidropIMAPSSLRetriever — same as MultidropIMAPRetriever, but uses
       SSL encryption.

    What is a "multidrop" mailbox? How do I know if I have one?

   Some ISPs, mailhosts, and other service providers provide a mail service
   they refer to as a "domain mailbox" or "multidrop mailbox". This is where
   they register a domain for you, and mail addressed to any local-part in
   that domain ends up in a single mailbox accessible via POP3, with the
   message envelope (envelope sender address and envelope recipient address)
   recorded properly in the message header, so that it can be re-constructed
   after you retrieve the messages with POP3 or IMAP. The primary benefit of
   this is that you can run your own MTA (qmail, Postfix, sendmail, Exchange,
   etc.) for your domain without having to have an SMTP daemon listening at a
   static IP address.

   Unfortunately, a lot of what is advertised and sold as multidrop service
   really isn't. In many cases, the envelope recipient address of the message
   is not properly recorded, so the envelope information is lost and cannot
   be reconstructed. If the envelope isn't properly preserved, it isn't a
   domain mailbox, and you therefore can't use a multidrop retriever with
   that mailbox.

   To determine if you have a multidrop mailbox, check the following list: if
   any of these items are not true, you do not have a multidrop mailbox.

     * the mailbox must receive one copy of the message for each envelope
       recipient in the domain; if the message was addressed to three
       local-parts in the domain, the mailbox must receive three separate
       copies of the message.
     * the envelope sender address must be recorded in a header field named
       Return-Path at the top of the message. If the message (incorrectly)
       already contained such a header field, it must be deleted before the
       envelope sender address is recorded.
     * the envelope recipient address must be recorded in a new header field.
       These may be named various things, but are commonly Delivered-To,
       X-Envelope-To, and similar values. In the case of messages which had
       multiple recipients in the domain, this must be a single address,
       reflecting the particular recipient of this copy of the message. Note
       that this field (and the envelope recipient address) are not related
       to informational header fields created by the originating MUA, like To
       or cc.

   If you're not sure whether you have a multidrop mailbox, you probably
   don't. You probably want to use SimplePOP3Retriever (for POP3 mail
   accounts) or SimpleIMAPRetriever (for IMAP mail accounts) retrievers.

   Specify the mail account type with one of the above values, like this:

 type = typename

   Then, include lines for any parameters and their values which are required
   by the retriever. The parameters and their types are documented below.

    Common retriever parameters

   All retriever types take several common required parameters:

     * server (string) — the name or IP address of the server to retrieve
       mail from
     * username (string) — username to provide when logging in to the mail
       server

   All retriever types also take several optional parameters:

     * port (integer) — the TCP port number to connect to. If not provided,
       the default is a port appropriate for the protocol (110 for POP3,
       etc.)
     * password (string) — password to use when logging in to the mail
       server. If not using Kerberos authentication -- see below -- getmail
       gets the password credential for the POP/IMAP server in one of the
       following ways:
         1. from the password configuration item in the getmailrc file
         2. by running an arbitrary command specified with the
            password_command parameter (see below)
         3. from Python keyring if available
         4. if not found via any of the above methods, getmail will prompt
            for the password when run
       To store your POP/IMAP account password into the Python keyring,
       ensure the password is not provided in the getmailrc file, and run
       getmail with the special option --store-password-in-keyring; getmail
       will run, prompt you for the password, store it in the Python keyring,
       and exit without retrieving mail. If this option is not recognized,
       your Python installation does not have Python keyring.
     * password_command (tuple of quoted strings) — retrieve the account
       password by running an arbitrary external program. The program must
       write the password and nothing else to stdout, and must exit with a
       status of 0 on success. Note that the password parameter (above)
       overrides this parameter; specify one or the other, not both. This
       parameter is specified as the program to run as the first string in
       the tuple, and all remaining strings are arguments passed to that
       program.

 password_command = ("/path/to/password-retriever", "-p", "myaccount@example.org")
        

   All IMAP retriever types also take the following optional parameters:

     * mailboxes (tuple of quoted strings) — a list of mailbox paths to
       retrieve mail from, expressed as a Python tuple. If not specified, the
       default is to retrieve mail from the mail folder named INBOX. You
       might want to retrieve messages from several different mail folders,
       using a configuration like this:

 mailboxes = ("INBOX", "INBOX.spam",
     "mailing-lists.model-railroading")
        

       Note that the format for hierarchical folder names is determined by
       the IMAP server, not by getmail. Consult your server's documentation
       or postmaster if you're unsure what form your server uses. If your
       mailbox names contain non-ASCII characters, ensure that your getmailrc
       file is stored with UTF-8 encoding so that getmail can correctly
       determine the unicode character names that need to be quoted in IMAP's
       modified UTF-7 encoding; if you do not do this, the mailbox names will
       not match what the server expects them to be, or will cause
       UnicodeErrors when attempting to load your getmailrc file. As a
       special case, in getmail version 4.29.0 and later, the unquoted base
       (non-tuple) value ALL (case-sensitive) means to retrieve mail from all
       selectable IMAP mailboxes in the account. To retrieve messages from
       all mailboxes, you would use:

 mailboxes = ALL
        

     * use_peek (boolean) — whether to use PEEK to retrieve the message; the
       default is True. IMAP servers typically mark a message as seen if PEEK
       is not used to retrieve the message content. Versions of getmail prior
       to 4.26.0 did not use PEEK to retrieve messages.
     * move_on_delete (string) — if set, messages are moved to the named IMAP
       mail folder before being deleted from their original location. The
       specified mail folder must exist; getmail will not create it. Note
       that if you configure getmail not to delete retrieved messages (the
       default behaviour), they will not be moved at all.
     * record_mailbox (boolean) — whether to add a
       X-getmail-retrieved-from-mailbox: header field to retrieved messages,
       containing the name of the selected mailbox that the message was
       retrieved from. This is on by default, but can be disabled.
     * use_kerberos (boolean) — whether to use Kerberos authentication with
       the IMAP server. If not set, normal password-based authenticaion is
       used. Note that when you use Kerberos authentication, it is up to you
       to ensure you have a valid Kerberos ticket (perhaps by running a
       ticket-renewing agent such as kstart or similar). This feature
       requires that a recent version of pykerberos with GSS support is
       installed; check your OS distribution or see
       http://honk.sigxcpu.org/projects/pykerberos/" for details.
     * use_xoauth2 (boolean) — whether to use XOAUTH2 for login with the IMAP
       server. If not set, normal password-based authenticaion is used. This
       is currently only supported with Gmail; if anyone extends this to
       support other IMAP providers, please let me know so I can include such
       support in getmail. Note that using XOAUTH2 is no more secure than a
       regular getmail configuration with a mode 0600 getmailrc file. You
       will need to set password_command as well to tell getmail to invoke
       the getmail-gmail-xoauth-tokens helper program; that script requires a
       positional argument to tell it where to read the initial tokens from
       and where it writes the access and refresh tokens to, and the file
       requires manual initial setup. This functionality was contributed by
       Stefan Krah, who has additional information about using it here.

    SSL Client Parameters

   All SSL-enabled retriever types also take the following options, to allow
   specifying the use of a particular client key and client certificate in
   establishing a connection to the server.

     * keyfile (string) — use the specified PEM-formatted key file in the SSL
       negotiation.
     * certfile (string) — use the specified PEM-formatted certificate file
       in the SSL negotiation.

    SSL Certificate Validation and Server Parameters

   All SSL-enabled POP and IMAP retriever types also take the following
   options, allowing you to require validation of the server's SSL
   certificate, or to check the server's certificate fingerprint against a
   known good value, or to control the specific SSL cipher used during the
   connection.

   Note: using these features, including server certificate validation,
   requires using Python 2.6 or Python 2.7 or higher with getmail. If you use
   an earlier version of Python, these features will not work, and no server
   certificate validation will be performed. Also note that these features
   are not currently implemented for SPDS retrievers; I would be interested
   in hearing from SPDS users who desire these features.

     * ca_certs (string) — advanced option to perform validation of the
       server's SSL certificate. Specify the path to a PEM-formatted list of
       1 or more valid and trusted root certification authority (CA)
       certificates. Note: this option is only available with Python 2.6 or
       higher.
       To find out which root CA is used to sign the chain of certificates
       for a given server, you can run

 openssl s_client -showcerts -connect HOST:PORT < /dev/null 2>/dev/null \
   | grep '^[[:space:]]*i:' | tail -n 1

       If the server's certificate cannot be validated based upon the
       supplied trusted root certificates, getmail will abort the connection.
       Root certificates are not supplied with getmail; your OS probably
       installs a set by default for use by the system, or you may wish to
       use a specific set of trusted root certificates provided by your
       employer or a trusted third party. Common locations for OS-supplied
       SSL root certification authority certificates include:
          * Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, SuSE):

 /etc/ssl/certs/

          * Linux (RedHat, Fedora, CentOS):

 /etc/pki/tls/certs/

          * FreeBSD:

 /usr/local/share/certs/

          * OpenBSD:

 /etc/ssl/

          * OSX:

 /System/Library/OpenSSL/certs/

          * Windows: ask Microsoft
     * ssl_ciphers (string) — advanced option to control which SSL cipher
       algorithms will be allowed to proceed. See the Open SSL documentation
       for details. If the specified setting results in no possible ciphers
       available, getmail will abort the connection. Note: this option is
       only available with Python 2.7 or higher.
     * ssl_version (string) — advanced option to control which SSL version
       getmail tries to use to connect to the server; the default is
       "sslv23". Another useful value is probably "sslv3". The available
       option values are taken from the Python ssl module. Note that this
       option exists only to help in connecting certain legacy, out-of-date,
       broken servers; most users should not specify this option at all.
       Using this option without knowing what you are doing can reduce the
       effectiveness of your encrypted connection. Note: this option is only
       available with Python 2.6 or higher. Note: see the FAQ for details on
       how to work around Gmail connection problems with OpenSSL v.1.1.1 and
       later.
     * ssl_fingerprints (tuple of quoted strings) — advanced option to notice
       when the server's SSL certificate changes. Supply a list of one or
       more SHA256 certificate fingerprints, and getmail will confirm whether
       the server's certificate fingerprint is in the list of allowed
       fingerprints; if it is not, getmail will abort the connection. Getmail
       will log the fingerprint of the server's certificate if you supply the
       --fingerprint commandline option. Note: this option is only available
       with Python 2.6 or higher.
     * ssl_cert_hostname (string) — advanced option to specify an alternate
       hostname which is expected in the server's SSL certificate hostname
       field. Specify this if the name used to connect to the server is known
       not to match the hostname in the server's certificate; otherwise,
       getmail will error out with a hostname mismatch.

    SimplePOP3Retriever

   The SimplePOP3Retriever class takes the common retriever parameters above,
   plus the following optional parameters:

     * use_apop (boolean) — if set to True, getmail will use APOP-style
       authentication to log in to the server instead of normal USER/PASS
       authentication. This is not supported by many POP3 servers. Note that
       APOP adds much less security than might be supposed; weaknesses in its
       hashing algorithm mean that an attacker can recover the first three
       characters of the password after snooping on only a few hundred
       authentications between a client and server — see
       http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/464477/30/0/threaded for
       details. The default is False.
     * timeout (integer) — how long (in seconds) to wait for socket
       operations to complete before considering them failed. If not
       specified, the default is 180 seconds. You may need to increase this
       value in particularly poor networking conditions.
     * delete_dup_msgids (boolean) — if set to True, and the POP3 server
       identifies multiple messages as having the same "unique" identifier,
       all but the first will be deleted without retrieving them.

    BrokenUIDLPOP3Retriever

   This retriever class is intended only for use with broken POP3 servers
   that either do not implement the UIDL command, or which do not properly
   assign unique identifiers to messages (preventing getmail from determining
   which messages it has seen before). It will identify every message in the
   mailbox as a new message, and therefore if you use this retriever class
   and opt not to delete messages after retrieval, it will retrieve those
   messages again the next time getmail is run. Use this retriever class only
   if your mailbox is hosted on such a broken POP3 server, and the server
   does not provide another means of getmail accessing it (i.e., IMAP).

   The BrokenUIDLPOP3Retriever class takes the common retriever parameters

       field which records the envelope recipient address. This is set to a
       value of the form field_name : field_position . The first (topmost)
       Delivered-To: header field would be specified as:

  Retriever examples

   A typical POP3 mail account (the basic kind of mailbox provided by most
   internet service providers (ISPs)) would use a retriever configuration
   like this:

 [retriever]
 type = SimplePOP3Retriever
 server = popmail.isp.example.net
 username = account_name
 password = my_mail_password

   If your ISP provides POP3 access on a non-standard port number, you would
   need to include the port parameter:

 [retriever]
 type = SimplePOP3Retriever
 server = popmail.isp.example.net
 port = 8110
 username = account_name
 password = my_mail_password

   If your ISP provides POP3-over-SSL and you wanted to use that, your
   retriever configuration might look like this:

 [retriever]
 type = SimplePOP3SSLRetriever
 server = popmail.isp.example.net
 username = account_name
 password = my_mail_password

   If you have an IMAP mail account and want to retrieve messages from
   several mail folders under that account, and you want to move messages to
   a special folder when deleting them, you would use a retriever
   configuration like this:

 [retriever]
 type = SimpleIMAPRetriever
 server = imapmail.isp.example.net
 username = account_name
 password = my_mail_password
 mailboxes = ("INBOX", "lists.unix", "lists.getmail")
 move_on_delete = mail.deleted

   If you are retrieving your company's mail from a domain POP3 mailbox for
   delivery to multiple local users, you might use a retriever configuration
   like this:

 [retriever]
 type = MultidropPOP3Retriever
 server = imapmail.isp.example.net
 username = account_name
 password = company_maildrop_password
 envelope_recipient = delivered-to:1

  Creating the [destination] section

   The destination section of the rc file tells getmail what to do with
   retrieved messages. Begin with the section header line as follows:

 [destination]

   Then, include a type string parameter to tell getmail what type of mail
   destination this is. The possible values are:

     * Maildir — deliver all messages to a local qmail-style maildir
     * Mboxrd — deliver all messages to a local mboxrd-format mbox file with
       fcntl-type locking.
     * MDA_external — use an external message delivery agent (MDA) to deliver
       messages. Typical MDAs include maildrop, procmail, and others.
     * MultiDestination — unconditionally deliver messages to multiple
       destinations (maildirs, mbox files, external MDAs, or other
       destinations).
     * MultiSorter — sort messages according to the envelope recipient
       (requires a domain mailbox retriever) and deliver to a variety of
       maildirs, mbox files, external MDAs, or other destinations based on
       regular expressions matching the recipient address of each message.
       Messages not matching any of the regular expressions are delivered to
       a default "postmaster" destination.
     * MultiGuesser — sort messages according to getmail's best guess at what
       the envelope recipient of the message might have been, and deliver to
       a variety of maildirs, mbox files, external MDAs, or other
       destinations based on regular expressions matching those addresses.
       Messages not matching any of the regular expressions are delivered to
       a default "postmaster" destination.
     * MDA_qmaillocal — use qmail-local to deliver messages according to
       instructions in a .qmail file.

    Maildir

   The Maildir destination delivers to a qmail-style maildir. The maildir
   must already exist, and must contain all of the subdirectories required by
   the maildir format. getmail will not create the maildir if it does not
   exist. If you're not familiar with the maildir format, the requirements in
   a nutshell are: it must be a directory containing three writable
   subdirectories cur, new, and tmp, and they must all reside on the same
   filesystem.

   The Maildir destination takes one required parameter:

     * path (string) — the path to the maildir, ending in slash (/). This
       value will be expanded for leading ~ or ~USER and environment
       variables in the form $VARNAME or ${VARNAME}. You might want to
       deliver messages to a maildir named Maildir in your home directory;
       you could do this with a configuration like this:

 [destination]
 type = Maildir
 path = ~/Maildir/
        

   The Maildir destination also takes two optional parameters:

     * user (string) — on Unix-like systems, if supplied, getmail will change
       the effective UID to that of the named user before delivering messages
       to the maildir. Note that this typically requires root privileges.
       getmail will not deliver to maildirs as root, so this "optional"
       parameter is required in that situation.
     * filemode (string) — if supplied, getmail will cause the delivered
       message files in the maildir to have at most these permissions (given
       in standard Unix octal notation). Note that the current umask is
       masked out of the given value at file creation time. The default
       value, which should be appropriate for most users, is "0600".

    Mboxrd

   The Mboxrd destination delivers to an mboxrd-format mbox file with either
   fcntl-type (lockf) or flock-type file locking. The file must already exist
   and appear to be a valid mboxrd file before getmail will try to deliver to
   it — getmail will not create the file if it does not exist. If you want to
   create a new mboxrd file for getmail to use, simply create a completely
   empty (0-byte) file.

   You must ensure that all other programs accessing any the mbox file expect
   mboxrd-format mbox files and the same type of file locking that you
   configure getmail to use; failure to do so can cause mbox corruption. If
   you do not know what type of file locking your system expects, ask your
   system administrator. If you are the system administrator and don't know
   what type of file locking your system expects, do not use Mboxrd files;
   use Maildirs instead. Note that delivering to mbox files over NFS can be
   unreliable and should be avoided; this is the case with any MDA.

   The Mboxrd destination takes one required parameter:

     * path (string) — the path to the mbox file. This value will be expanded
       for leading ~ or ~USER and environment variables in the form $VARNAME
       or ${VARNAME}. You might want to deliver messages to an mbox file
       named inbox in your home directory; you could do this with a
       configuration like this:

 [destination]
 type = Mboxrd
 path = ~/inbox
        

   The Mboxrd destination also takes two optional parameters:

     * user (string) — on Unix-like systems, if supplied, getmail will change
       the effective UID to that of the named user before delivering messages
       to the mboxrd file. Note that this typically requires root privileges.
       getmail will not deliver to mbox files as root, so this "optional"
       parameter is required in that situation.
     * locktype (string) — which type of file locking to use; may be "lockf"
       (for fcntl locking) or "flock". The default in getmail 4.7.0 and later
       is lockf.

    MDA_external

   MDA_external delivers messages by running an external program (known as a
   message delivery agent, or MDA) and feeding it the message on its standard
   input. Some typical MDAs include maildrop and procmail.

   The MDA_external destination takes one required parameter:

     * path (string) — the path to the command to run. This value will be
       expanded for leading ~ or ~USER and environment variables in the form
       $VARNAME or ${VARNAME}.

   The MDA_external destination also takes several optional parameters:

     * arguments (tuple of quoted strings) — arguments to be supplied to the
       command. The following substrings will be substituted with the
       equivalent values from the message:
          * %(sender) — envelope return-path address
       If the message is retrieved with a multidrop retriever class, the
       message recipient (and parts of it) are also available with the
       following replacement substrings:
          * %(recipient) — envelope recipient address
          * %(local) — local-part of the envelope recipient address
          * %(domain) — domain-part of the envelope recipient address
          * %(mailbox) — the IMAP mailbox name the message was retrieved
            from; for POP, this will be empty
       The default value of the arguments parameter is (), so no arguments
       are supplied to the command.
     * unixfrom (boolean) — whether to include a Unix-style mbox From_ line
       at the beginning of the message supplied to the command. Defaults to
       false. Some MDAs expect such a line to be present and will fail to
       operate if it is missing.
     * user (string) — if supplied, getmail will change the effective UID to
       that of the named user. Note that this typically requires root
       privileges.
     * group (string) — if supplied, getmail will change the effective GID to
       that of the named group. Note that this typically requires root
       privileges.
     * allow_root_commands (boolean) — if set, getmail will run external
       commands even if it is currently running with root privileges. The
       default is false, which causes getmail to raise an exception if it is
       asked to run an external command as root. Note that setting this
       option has serious security implications. Don't use it if you don't
       know what you're doing. I strongly recommend against running external
       processes as root.
     * ignore_stderr (boolean) — if set, getmail will not consider it an
       error if the program writes to stderr. The default is false, which
       causes getmail to consider the delivery failed and leave the message
       on the server, proceeding to the next message. This prevents loss of
       mail if the MDA writes to stderr but fails to exit nonzero when it
       encounters an error. Note that setting this option has serious
       implications; some MDAs can fail to deliver a message but still exit
       0, which can cause loss of mail if this option is set. Only change
       this setting if you are confident your MDA always exits nonzero on
       error.

   A basic invocation of an external MDA might look like this:

 [destination]
 type = MDA_external
 path = /path/to/mymda
 arguments = ("--log-errors", )

   Something more complex might look like this:

 [destination]
 type = MDA_external
 path = /path/to/mymda
 # Switch to fred's UID and the mail group GID before delivering his mail
 user = fred
 group = mail
 arguments = ("--strip-forbidden-attachments", "--recipient=%(recipient)")

    MultiDestination

   MultiDestination doesn't do any message deliveries itself; instead, it
   lets you specify a list of one or more other destinations which it will
   pass each message to. You can use this to deliver each message to several
   different destinations.

   The MultiDestination destination takes one required parameter:

     * destinations (tuple of quoted strings) — the destinations which the
       messages will be passed to. A destination is a string that refers to
       another configuration file section by name (shortcuts for maildirs and
       mboxrd files are also provided; see below), like this:

 destinations = ('[other-destination-1]', '[other-destination-2]')

 [other-destination-1]
 type = Mboxrd
 path = /var/spool/mail/alice
 user = alice

 [other-destination-2]
 type = Maildir
 path = /home/joe/Maildir/
 user = joe

       Because Maildir and Mboxrd destinations are common, you can specify
       them directly as a shortcut if they do not require a user parameter.
       If the string (after expansion; see below) starts with a dot or slash
       and ends with a slash, it specifies the path of a Maildir destination,
       while if it starts with a dot or a slash and does not end with a
       slash, it specifies the path of a Mboxrd destination.

       For instance, you can deliver mail to two maildirs with the following:

 destinations = ('~/Mail/inbox/', '~/Mail/archive/current/')

       Each destination string is first expanded for leading ~ or ~USER and
       environment variables in the form $VARNAME or ${VARNAME}.

   Some examples:

     * To deliver to a maildir named Maildir in the home directory of user
       jeff, when getmail is run as that user:

 [destination]
 type = MultiDestination
 destinations = ("~jeff/Maildir/", )

     * To deliver to an mboxrd file:

 [destination]
 type = MultiDestination
 destinations = ("/var/spool/mail/alice", )

     * To deliver with an external MDA:

 [destination]
 type = MultiDestination
 destinations = ("[procmail-as-bob]", )

 [procmail-as-bob]
 type = MDA_external
 path = /path/to/procmail
 arguments = ('~bob/.procmailrc', '-f', '%(sender)')
 user = bob

   Of course, the whole point of MultiDestination is to allow you to specify
   multiple destinations, like this:

 [destination]
 type = MultiDestination
 destinations = (
     "~jeff/Mail/inbox",
     "[procmail-as-jeff]",
     "/var/mail-archive/incoming"
     )

 [procmail-as-jeff]
 type = MDA_external
 path = /path/to/procmail
 arguments = ('~jeff/.procmailrc', '-f', '%(sender)')
 user = jeff

    MultiSorter

   MultiSorter compares the envelope recipient address of messages against a
   list of user-supplied regular expressions and delivers the message to the
   destination (maildir, mboxrd file, or other) associated with any matching
   patterns. A message can match multiple patterns and therefore be delivered
   to multiple matching destinations. Any message which matches none of the
   patterns is delivered to a default destination for the postmaster.

   Because MultiSorter requires the envelope recipient to operate, it must be
   used with a domain mailbox retriever. If you instead want to do some basic
   message sorting based on getmail's best guess as to the envelope recipient
   of the message, see the MultiGuesser destination class below.

   The MultiSorter destination takes one required parameter:

     * default (string) — the destination for messages which aren't matched
       by any of the "locals" regular expressions. The destination can be a
       maildir, mboxrd file, or other destination. See MultiDestination for
       an explanation of how the type of destination is interpreted from this
       value.

   The MultiSorter destination also takes one optional parameter:

     * locals (tuple of 2-tuples) — zero or more regular expression –
       destination pairs. Messages will be delivered to each destination for
       which the envelope recipient matches the given regular expression. The
       regular expression and destination are supplied as two quoted strings
       in a tuple; locals is then a tuple of such pairs of strings.
       Destinations are specified in the same manner as with the "default"
       parameter, above.

   Important note: if your regular expression contains backslashes (by
   themselves, or as part of an escaped character or symbol like \n or \W ),
   you need to tell the parser that this expression must be parsed "raw" by
   prepending the string with an "r":

 locals = (
     (r'jeff\?\?\?@.*', '[jeff]'),
     ('alice@', '[alice]')
     )

 locals = (
     ('jeff@.*', '[jeff]'),
     (r'alice\D+@', '[alice]')
     )

   Note that if you don't understand regular expressions, you don't need to
   worry about it. In general, an email address is a regular expression that
   matches itself. The only significant times this isn't the case is when the
   address contains odd punctuation characters like ^, $, \, or [. Handy
   hints:

     * the regular expression . (dot) matches anything
     * matches can occur anywhere in the address. If you want to only match
       at the beginning, start your expression with the ^ character. If you
       only want to match the whole address, also end your expression with a
       dollar sign $.

   Using regular expressions:

     * The regular expression joe@example.org matches the addresses
       joe@example.org, joe@example.org.net, and heyjoe@example.org.
     * The regular expression ^jeff@ matches the addresses jeff@example.org
       and jeff@example.net, but not otherjeff@example.org.
     * The regular expression sam matches the addresses sam@example.org,
       samantha@example.org, asam@example.org, and chris@isam.example.net.

   Some examples:

     *    * Deliver mail matching jeff@example.net to ~jeff/Maildir/
          * Deliver mail matching alice@anything to ~alice/inbox
          * Deliver all other mail to ~bob/Maildir/

 [destination]
 type = MultiSorter
 default = [bob-default]
 locals = (
     ('jeff@example.net', '[jeff]'),
     ('alice@', '[alice]')
     )

 [jeff]
 type = Maildir
 path = ~jeff/Maildir/
 user = jeff

 [alice]
 type = Mboxrd
 path = ~alice/inbox
 user = alice

 [bob-default]
 type = Maildir
 path = ~bob/Maildir/
 user = bob

     *    * Deliver mail for jeff, bob, and alice to maildirs in their home
            directories
          * Deliver copies of all messages to samantha's mail archive
          * Deliver copies of all messages to a program that logs certain
            information. This program should run as the user log, and command
            arguments should tell it to record the info to /var/log/mail/info

 [destination]
 type = MultiSorter
 default = doesn't matter, this won't be used, as locals will always match
 locals = (
     ('^jeff@', '[jeff]'),
     ('^bob@', '[bob]'),
     ('^alice@', '[alice]'),
     ('.', '[copies]'),
     ('.', '[info]')
     )

 [alice]
 type = Maildir
 path = ~alice/Maildir/
 user = alice

 [bob]
 type = Maildir
 path = ~bob/Maildir/
 user = bob

 [jeff]
 type = Maildir
 path = ~jeff/Maildir/
 user = jeff

 [copies]
 type = Maildir
 path = ~samantha/Mail/archive/copies/
 user = samantha

 [info]
 type = MDA_external
 path = /path/to/infologger
 arguments = ('--log=/var/log/mail/info', '--sender=%(sender)', '--recipient=%(recipient))
 user = log

    MultiGuesser

   MultiGuesser tries to guess what the envelope recipient address of the
   message might have been, by comparing addresses found in the message
   header against a list of user-supplied regular expressions, and delivers
   the message to the destination (maildir, mboxrd file, or other) associated
   with any matching patterns. A message can match multiple patterns and
   therefore be delivered to multiple matching destinations. Any message
   which matches none of the patterns is delivered to a default destination
   for the postmaster. In this fashion, you can do basic mail filtering and
   sorting with getmail without using an external filtering message delivery
   agent (MDA) (such as maildrop or procmail), if and only if the message
   recipient is the criteria you want to filter on.

   If you want to filter based on arbitrary message critera, like "What
   address is in the To: header field?" or "Who is the message from?", then
   use the filtering MDA of your choice, called from a getmail MDA_external
   destination.

   MultiGuesser is similar to MultiSorter, except that it does not operate on
   the true envelope recipient address, and therefore does not require a
   domain mailbox retriever. Because it is "guessing" at the intended
   recipient of the message based on the contents of the message header, it
   is fallible — for instance, the address of a recipient of a mailing list
   message may not appear in the header of the message at all. If your locals
   regular expression patterns are only looking for that address,
   MultiGuesser will then have to deliver it to the destination specified as
   the default recipient.

   This functionality is very similar to the guessing functionality of
   getmail version 2, which was removed in version 3. MultiGuesser extracts a
   list of addresses from the message header like this:

    1. it looks for addresses in any Delivered-To: header fields.
    2. if no addresses have been found, it looks for addresses in any
       Envelope-To: header fields.
    3. if no addresses have been found, it looks for addresses in any
       X-Envelope-To: header fields.
    4. if no addresses have been found, it looks for addresses in any
       Apparently-To: header fields.
    5. if no addresses have been found, it looks for addresses in any
       Resent-to: or Resent-cc: header fields (or Resent-bcc:, which
       shouldn't be present).
    6. if no addresses have been found, it looks for addresses in any To: or
       cc: header fields (or bcc:, which shouldn't be present).

   The MultiGuesser destination takes one required parameter:

     * default (string) — see MultiSorter for definition.

   The MultiGuesser destination also takes one optional parameter:

     * locals (tuple of 2-tuples) — see MultiSorter for definition.

   Examples:

   If you have a simple POP3 account (i.e. it's not a multidrop mailbox) and
   you want to deliver your personal mail to your regular maildir, but
   deliver mail from a couple of mailing lists (identified by the list
   address appearing in the message header) to separate maildirs, you could
   use a MultiGuesser configuration like this:

 [destination]
 type = MultiGuesser
 default = ~/Maildir/
 locals = (
     ("list-address-1@list-domain-1", "~/Mail/mailing-lists/list-1/"),
     ("list-address-2@list-domain-2", "~/Mail/mailing-lists/list-2/"),
     )

   See MultiSorter above for other examples of getmail rc usage; the only
   difference is the type parameter specifying the MultiGuesser destination.

    MDA_qmaillocal

   MDA_qmaillocal delivers messages by running the qmail-local program as an
   external MDA. qmail-local uses .qmail files to tell it what to do with
   messages. If you're not already familiar with qmail, you don't need to use
   this destination class.

   The MDA_qmaillocal destination takes several optional parameters:

     * qmaillocal (string) — path to the qmail-local program. The default
       value is /var/qmail/bin/qmail-local.
     * user (string) — supplied to qmail-local, and also tells getmail to
       change the current effective UID to that of the named user before
       running qmail-local. Note that this typically requires root
       privileges. The default value is the account name of the current
       effective UID.
     * group (string) — if supplied, getmail will change the effective GID to
       that of the named group before running qmail-local. Note that this
       typically requires root privileges.
     * homedir (string) — supplied to qmail-local. The default value is the
       home directory of the account with the current effective UID.
     * localdomain (string) — supplied to qmail-local as its domain argument.
       The default value is the fully-qualified domain name of the local
       host.
     * defaultdelivery (string) — supplied to qmail-local as its
       defaultdelivery argument. The default value is ./Maildir/.
     * conf-break (string) — supplied to qmail-local as its dash argument.
       The default value is -.
     * localpart_translate (2-tuple of quoted strings) — if supplied, the
       recipient address of the message (which is used to construct the local
       argument (among others) to qmail-local) will have any leading instance
       of the first string replaced with the second string. This can be used
       to remap recipient addresses, trim extraneous prefixes (such as the
       qmail virtualdomain prepend value), or perform other tasks. The
       default value is ('', '') (i.e., no translation).
     * strip_delivered_to (boolean) — if set, Delivered-To: header fields
       will be removed from the message before handing it to qmail-local.
       This may be necessary to prevent qmail-local falsely detecting a
       looping message if (for instance) the system retrieving messages
       otherwise believes it has the same domain name as the retrieval
       server. Inappropriate use of this option may cause message loops. The
       default value is False.
     * allow_root_commands (boolean) — if set, getmail will run qmail-local
       even if it is currently running with root privileges. The default is
       false, which causes getmail to raise an exception if it is asked to
       run an external command as root. Note that setting this option has
       serious security implications. Don't use it if you don't know what
       you're doing. I strongly recommend against running external processes
       as root.

   A basic invocation of qmail-local might look like this:

 [destination]
 type = MDA_qmaillocal
 user = joyce

   Something more complex might look like this:

 [destination]
 type = MDA_qmaillocal
 user = joyce
 # The mail domain isn't the normal FQDN of the server running getmail
 localdomain = host.example.net
 # Trim the server's virtualdomain prepend value from message recipient before
 # sending it to qmail-local
 localpart_translate = ('mailhostaccount-', '')

  Creating the [options] section

   The optional options section of the rc file can be used to alter getmail's
   default behaviour. The parameters supported in this section are as
   follows:

     * verbose (integer) — controls getmail's verbosity. If set to 2, getmail
       prints messages about each of its actions. If set to 1, it prints
       messages about retrieving and deleting messages (only). If set to 0,
       getmail will only print warnings and errors. Default: 1.
     * read_all (boolean) — if set, getmail retrieves all available messages.
       If unset, getmail only retrieves messages it has not seen before.
       Default: True.
     * delete (boolean) — if set, getmail will delete messages after
       retrieving and successfully delivering them. If unset, getmail will
       leave messages on the server after retrieving them. Default: False.
     * delete_after (integer) — if set, getmail will delete messages this
       number of days after first seeing them, if they have been retrieved
       and delivered. This, in effect, leaves messages on the server for a
       configurable number of days after retrieving them. Note that the
       delete parameter has higher priority; if both are set, the messages
       will be deleted immediately. Default: 0, which means not to enable
       this feature.
     * delete_bigger_than (integer) — if set, getmail will delete messages
       larger than this number of bytes after retrieving them, even if the
       delete and delete_after options are disabled. The purpose of this
       feature is to allow deleting only large messages, to help keep a
       mailbox under quota. Has no effect if delete is set, as that will
       unconditionally remove messages. If delete_after is also set, the
       message will be deleted immediately after retrieval if it is over this
       size, and otherwise will be deleted according to the setting of
       delete_after. Default: 0, which means not to enable this feature.
     * max_bytes_per_session (integer) — if set, getmail will retrieve
       messages totalling up to this number of bytes before closing the
       session with the server. This can be useful if you do not want large
       messages causing large bursts of network traffic. Default: 0, which
       means not to enable this feature. Note that message sizes reported by
       the server are used, and therefore may vary slightly from the actual
       size on disk after message retrieval.
     * max_message_size (integer) — if set, getmail will not retrieve
       messages larger than this number of bytes. Default: 0, which means not
       to enable this feature.
     * max_messages_per_session (integer) — if set, getmail will process a
       maximum of this number of messages before closing the session with the
       server. This can be useful if your network or the server is
       particuarly unreliable. Default: 0, which means not to enable this
       feature.
     * delivered_to (boolean) — if set, getmail adds a Delivered-To: header
       field to the message. If unset, it will not do so. Default: True. Note
       that this field will contain the envelope recipient of the message if
       the retriever in use is a multidrop retriever; otherwise it will
       contain the string "unknown".
     * received (boolean) — if set, getmail adds a Received: header field to
       the message. If unset, it will not do so. Default: True.
     * message_log (string) — if set, getmail will record a log of its
       actions to the named file. The value will be expanded for leading ~ or
       ~USER and environment variables in the form $VARNAME or ${VARNAME}.
       Default: '' (the empty string), which means not to enable this
       feature.
     * message_log_syslog (boolean) — if set, getmail will record a log of
       its actions using the system logger. Note that syslog is inherently
       unreliable and can lose log messages. Default: False.
     * message_log_verbose (boolean) — if set, getmail will log to the
       message log file (or syslog) information about messages not retrieved
       and the reason for not retrieving them, as well as starting and ending
       information lines. By default, it will log only about messages
       actually retrieved, and about error conditions. Note that this has no
       effect if neither message_log nor message_log_syslog is in use.
       Default: False.

   Most users will want to either enable the delete option (to delete mail
   after retrieving it), or disable the read_all option (to only retrieve
   previously-unread mail).

   The verbose, read_all, and delete parameters can be overridden at run time
   with commandline options.

    [options] example

   To configure getmail to operate quietly, to retrieve only new mail, to
   delete messages after retrieving them, and to log its actions to a file,
   you could provide the following in your getmail rc file(s):

 [options]
 verbose = 0
 read_all = false
 delete = true
 message_log = ~/.getmail/log

  Creating the [filter-something] sections

   The filter-something section(s) of the rc file (which are not required)
   tell getmail to process messages in some way after retrieving them, but
   before delivering them to your destinations. Filters can tell getmail to
   drop a message (i.e. not deliver it at all), add information to the
   message header (i.e. for a spam- classification system or similar), or
   modify message content (like an antivirus system stripping suspected MIME
   parts from messages).

   You can specify any number of filters; provide a separate rc file section
   for each, naming each of them filter-something. They will be run in
   collated order, so it's likely simplest to name them like this:

     * [filter-1]
     * [filter-2]
     * [filter-3]

   Begin with the section header line as follows:

 [filter-something]

   Then, include a type string parameter to tell getmail what type of filter.
   The possible values are:

     * Filter_classifier — run the message through an external program, and
       insert the output of the program into X-getmail-filter-classifier:
       header fields in the message. Messages can be dropped by having the
       filter return specific exit codes.
     * Filter_external — supply the message to an external program, which can
       then modify the message in any fashion. The program must print the
       modified message to stdout. getmail reads the modified message from
       the program in this fasion before proceeding to the next filter or
       destination. Messages can be dropped by having the filter return
       specific exit codes.
     * Filter_TMDA — run the message through the tmda-filter program for use
       with the Tagged Message Delivery Agent (TMDA) package. If tmda-filter
       returns 0, the message will be passed to the next filter (or
       destination). If it returns 99, the message will be dropped, and TMDA
       is responsible for sending a challenge message, queuing the original,
       etc., as with normal TMDA operation in a .qmail, .courier, or .forward
       file.

   By default, if a filter writes anything to stderr, getmail will consider
   the delivery to have encountered an error. getmail will leave the message
   on the server and proceed to the next message. You must configure any
   filter you use not to emit messages to stderr except on errors — please
   see the documentation for your filter program for details. Optionally, if
   you know your filter can emit warnings on stderr under non-error
   conditions, you can set the ignore_stderr option.

    Filter_classifier

   Filter_classifier runs the message through an external program, placing
   the output of that program into X-getmail-filter-classifier: header
   fields. It can also cause messages to be dropped by exiting with a return
   code listed in the exitcodes_drop parameter.

   Filter_classifier has one required parameter:

     * path (string) — the path to the command to run. This value will be
       expanded for leading ~ or ~USER and environment variables in the form
       $VARNAME or ${VARNAME}.

   In addition, Filter_classifier takes the following optional parameters:

     * arguments (tuple of quoted strings) — arguments to be supplied to the
       command. The following substrings will be substituted with the
       equivalent values from the message:
          * %(sender) — envelope return-path address
       If the message is retrieved with a multidrop retriever class, the
       message recipient (and parts of it) are also available with the
       following replacement substrings:
          * %(recipient) — envelope recipient address
          * %(local) — local-part of the envelope recipient address
          * %(domain) — domain-part of the envelope recipient address
       The default value of the arguments parameter is (), so no arguments
       are supplied to the command.
     * unixfrom (boolean) — whether to include a Unix-style mbox From_ line
       at the beginning of the message supplied to the command. Default:
       False.
     * user (string) — if supplied, getmail will change the effective UID to
       that of the named user. Note that this typically requires root
       privileges.
     * group (string) — if supplied, getmail will change the effective GID to
       that of the named group. Note that this typically requires root
       privileges.
     * allow_root_commands (boolean) — if set, getmail will run external
       commands even if it is currently running with root privileges. The
       default is false, which causes getmail to raise an exception if it is
       asked to run an external command as root. Note that setting this
       option has serious security implications. Don't use it if you don't
       know what you're doing. I strongly recommend against running external
       processes as root.
     * ignore_stderr (boolean) — if set, getmail will not consider it an
       error if the filter writes to stderr. The default is false, which
       causes getmail to consider the delivery failed and leave the message
       on the server, proceeding to the next message. This prevents loss of
       mail if the filter writes to stderr but fails to exit nonzero when it
       encounters an error. Note that setting this option has serious
       implications; some poorly-written programs commonly used as mail
       filters can can mangle or drop mail but still exit 0, their only clue
       to failure being warnings emitted on stderr. Only change this setting
       if you are confident your filter always exits nonzero on error.
     * exitcodes_drop (tuple of integers) — if the filter returns an exit
       code in this list, the message will be dropped. The default is (99,
       100).
     * exitcodes_keep (tuple of integers) — if the filter returns an exit
       code other than those in exitcodes_drop and exitcodes_keep, getmail
       assumes the filter encountered an error. getmail will then not
       proceed, so that the message is not lost. The default is (0, ).

    Filter_external

   Filter_external runs the message through an external program, and replaces
   the message with the output of that program, allowing the filter to make
   arbitrary changes to messages. It can also cause messages to be dropped by
   exiting with a return code listed in the exitcodes_drop parameter.

   Filter_external has one required parameter:

     * path (string) — see Filter_classifier for definition.

   In addition, Filter_external takes the following optional parameters:

     * arguments (tuple of quoted strings) — see Filter_classifier for
       definition.
     * unixfrom (boolean) — see Filter_classifier for definition.
     * user (string) — see Filter_classifier for definition.
     * group (string) — see Filter_classifier for definition.
     * allow_root_commands (boolean) — see Filter_classifier for definition.
     * ignore_header_shrinkage (boolean) — by default, getmail will warn if a
       filtered message's header contains fewer fields than the source
       message had, to warn you if your filter is unexpectedly deleting
       information from messages it handles. If you know your filter can
       legitimately produce a message with a shorter header (such as if it
       encapsulates the original message), set this option to disable the
       warning. Do not simply set this if you see the warning; you must
       understand whether your filter is operating correctly or not before
       you use this.
     * ignore_stderr (boolean) — see Filter_classifier for definition.
     * exitcodes_drop (tuple of integers) — see Filter_classifier for
       definition.
     * exitcodes_keep (tuple of integers) — see Filter_classifier for
       definition.

    Filter_TMDA

   Filter_external runs the message through the external program tmda-filter,
   allowing the use of the Tagged Message Delivery Agent (TMDA) package. As
   TMDA relies on the message envelope, this filter requires the use of a
   multidrop retriever class to function. It sets the three environment
   variables SENDER, RECIPIENT, and EXT prior to running tmda-filter.

   I've tested this filter, and it Works For Me™, but I'm not a regular TMDA
   user. I would appreciate any feedback about its use from TMDA users.

   Filter_TMDA has no required parameters. It has the following optional
   parameters:

     * path (string) — the path to the tmda-filter binary. Default:
       /usr/local/bin/tmda-filter. This value will be expanded for leading ~
       or ~USER and environment variables in the form $VARNAME or ${VARNAME}.
     * user (string) — see Filter_classifier for definition.
     * group (string) — see Filter_classifier for definition.
     * allow_root_commands (boolean) — see Filter_classifier for definition.
     * ignore_stderr (boolean) — see Filter_classifier for definition.
     * conf-break (string) — this value will be used to split the local-part
       of the envelope recipient address to determine the value of the EXT
       environment variable. For example, if the envelope sender address is
       sender-something@host.example.org, and the envelope recipient address
       is user-ext-ext2@host.example.net, and conf-break is set to -, getmail
       will set the environment variables SENDER to
       "sender-something@host.example.org", RECIPIENT to
       "user-ext-ext2@host.example.net", and EXT to "ext-ext2". Default: "-".

    [filter-something] examples

   You might filter spam messages in your MUA based on information added to
   the message header by a spam-classification program. You could have that
   information added to the message header with a filter configuration like
   this:

 [filter-3]
 type = Filter_classifier
 path = /path/to/my-classifier
 arguments = ('--message-from-stdin', '--report-to-stdout')
 user = nobody

   You might use a program to prevent users from accidentally destroying
   their data by stripping suspected attachments from messages. You could
   have that information added to the message header with a filter
   configuration like this:

 [filter-3]
 type = Filter_external
 path = /path/to/my-mime-filter
 arguments = ('--message-from-stdin', '--remove-all-but-attachment-types=text/plain,text/rfc822')
 user = nobody

   You might use TMDA to challenge messages from unknown senders. If the
   default parameters are fine for your configuration, this is as simple as:

 [filter-3]
 type = Filter_TMDA

  getmail rc file examples

   Several examples of different getmail rc configuration are available in
   the included file getmailrc-examples.

                                Running getmail

   To use getmail, simply run the script getmail, which is typically
   installed in /usr/local/bin/ by default. getmail will read the default
   getmail rc file (getmailrc) from the default configuration/data directory
   (~/.getmail/) and begin operating.

   You can modify this behaviour by supplying commandline options to getmail.

Commandline options

   getmail understands the following options:

     * --version — show getmail's version number and exit
     * --help or -h — show a brief usage summary and exit
     * --getmaildir=DIR or -gDIR — use DIR for configuration and data files
     * --rcfile=FILE or -rFILE — read getmail rc file FILE instead of the
       default. The file path is assumed to be relative to the getmaildir
       directory unless this value starts with a slash (/). This option can
       be given multiple times to have getmail retrieve mail from multiple
       accounts.
     * --dump — read rc files, dump configuration, and exit (debugging)
     * --trace — print extended debugging information

   If you are using a single getmailrc file with an IMAP server that
   understands the IDLE extension from RFC 2177, you can use the
   --idle=MAILBOX option to specify that getmail should wait on the server to
   notify getmail of new mail in the specified mailbox after getmail is
   finished retrieving mail.

   In addition, the following commandline options can be used to override any
   values specified in the [options] section of the getmail rc files:

     * --verbose or -v — operate more verbosely. Can be given multiple times.
     * --quiet or -q — print only warnings or errors while running
     * --delete or -d — delete messages after retrieving
     * --dont-delete or -l — do not delete messages after retrieving
     * --all or -a — retrieve all messages
     * --new or -n — retrieve only new (unseen) messages

   For instance, if you want to retrieve mail from two different mail
   accounts, create a getmail rc file for each of them (named, say,
   getmailrc-account1 and getmailrc-account2) and put them in ~/.getmail/ or
   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/getmail/. Then run getmail as follows:

 $ getmail --rcfile getmailrc-account1 --rcfile getmailrc-account2

   If those files were located in a directory other than the default, and you
   wanted to use that directory for storing the data files as well, you could
   run getmail as follows:

 $ getmail --getmaildir /path/to/otherdir --rcfile getmailrc-account1 --rcfile getmailrc-account2

Using getmail as an MDA

   getmail includes helper scripts which allow you to use it to deliver mail
   from other programs to maildirs or mboxrd files.

  Using the getmail_maildir MDA

   The getmail_maildir script can be used as an MDA from other programs to
   deliver mail to maildirs. It reads the mail message from stdin, and
   delivers it to a maildir path provided as an argument on the commandline.
   This path must (after expansion by the shell, if applicable) start with a
   dot or slash and end with a slash.

   getmail_maildir uses the contents of the SENDER environment variable to
   construct a Return-Path: header field and the contents of the RECIPIENT
   environment variable to construct a Delivered-To: header field at the top
   of the message.

   getmail_maildir also accepts the options --verbose or -v which tell it to
   print a status message on success. The default is to operate silently
   unless an error occurs.

    Example

   You could deliver a message to a maildir named Maildir located in your
   home directory by running the following command with the message on stdin:

 $ getmail_maildir $HOME/Maildir/

  Using the getmail_mbox MDA

   The getmail_mbox script can be used as an MDA from other programs to
   deliver mail to mboxrd-format mbox files. It reads the mail message from
   stdin, and delivers it to an mbox path provided as an argument on the
   commandline. This path must (after expansion by the shell, if applicable)
   start with a dot or slash and not end with a slash.

   getmail_maildir uses the contents of the SENDER environment variable to
   construct a Return-Path: header field and mbox From_ line and the contents
   of the RECIPIENT environment variable to construct a Delivered-To: header
   field at the top of the message.

   getmail_mbox also accepts the options --verbose or -v which tell it to
   print a status message on success. The default is to operate silently
   unless an error occurs.

    Example

   You could deliver a message to an mboxrd-format mbox file named inbox
   located in a directory named mail in your home directory by running the

Using getmail_fetch to retrieve mail from scripts

   getmail includes the getmail_fetch helper script, which allows you to
   retrieve mail from a POP3 server without the use of a configuration file.
   It is primarily intended for use in automated or scripted environments,
   but can be used to retrieve mail normally.

   See the getmail_fetch manual page for details on the use of getmail_fetch.
