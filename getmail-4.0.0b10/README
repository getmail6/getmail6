getmail version 4 -- a flexible, extensible mail retrieval system with
support for POP3, IMAP4, SSL variants of both, maildirs, mboxrd files, 
external MDAs, arbitrary message filtering, single-user and domain-mailboxes,
and many other useful features.

getmail version 4 requires Python version 2.3.3 or later.  You can have
several installed versions of Python peacefully co-existing, see
python.org for details.

To install:  getmail v.4 uses the standard Python distutils.  Do the following
  as a regular user:

    python setup.py build

  Then (probably as root), do:

    python setup.py install

  This will install the software as follows:

    -the three scripts will be installed in <PREFIX>/bin/
    -the Python files will be installed under the site-packages directory of
     your Python installation (typically /usr/local/lib/pythonXXX or
     /usr/lib/pythonXXX, but may be elsewhere -- this is detected automatically)
    -the documentation will be installed under <PREFIX>/doc/getmail-<version>/
    -the man pages will be installed under <PREFIX>/man/

  <PREFIX> is the directory Python was configured to install under (typically
  either /usr/local/ or /usr/, but may be another value).  See the file
  docs/documentation.html or docs/documentation.txt for details on installing
  files to directories other than these defaults.

The three scripts included in the package (getmail, getmail_maildir, and
getmail_mbox) will have their "#!"-interpreter line automatically modified
to invoke the Python interpreter you run the setup script with.  If you later
remove this version of Python, and the newer version does not provide a link
to the interpreter with that name, you may have to modify the scripts.

See the HTML documentation for details on setting up and using getmail.
It is included in the docs subdirectory of the distribution tarball, and will
be installed in <PREFIX>/doc/getmail-<version>/ (by default).

See docs/BUGS for instructions on reporting bugs in this software.
