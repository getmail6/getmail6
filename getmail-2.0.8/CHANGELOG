Version 2.0.8
14 January 2001

  -Aijaz Ansari reported a bug:  if the first address found in a message
  was illegally formatted in a certain way, Python's rfc822 module could return
  None instead of a string for the address.  getmail would then throw an
  exception.  getmail now contains a workaround for this bug.
